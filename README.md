Sometimes I reference things and programming is fun. üêí

I added this repo to develop and store functions and other objects related to different algorithms, models, and data structures over time. The functions will likely follow the pattern of first draft ideation followed by revision with attention to optimization or code design as I find opportunities to improve the code base. 

The projected result of this project is the creation of a repo that acts as a quick reference library for me to find algorithm implementations. An even better result would be a repurposable library of classes and algorithms for future projects. 

Thanks for reading!
